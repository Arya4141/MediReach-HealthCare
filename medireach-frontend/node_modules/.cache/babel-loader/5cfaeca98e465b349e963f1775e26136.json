If you have to be around\n                people, maintain a distance of 2 meters or 6 feet from others\n                around you as much as possible. Not just mass gatherings, but\n                even shopping malls, stadiums, and movie theatres can make you a\n                target. In general, any gathering of over ten people should be\n                avoided or conducted virtually.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <Footer />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Guidelines;\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,OAAOC,MAAP,MAAmB,gCAAnB;AACA,OAAOC,MAAP,MAAmB,gCAAnB;AACA,OAAO,mBAAP;;;AAEA,MAAMC,UAAU,GAAG,MAAM;EACvB,oBACE;IAAA,wBACE,QAAC,MAAD;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QADF,eAEE;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,YAAf;MAAA,uBACE;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAf;QAAA,wBACE;UAAI,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAd;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADF,eAIE;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,kBAAf;UAAA,wBACE;YAAK,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAf;YAAA,wBACE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADF,eAEE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAFF;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QADF,eAOE;YAAK,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAf;YAAA,wBACE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADF,eAEE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAFF;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAPF,eA4BE;YAAK,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAf;YAAA,wBACE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADF,eAEE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAFF;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QA5BF,eAkCE;YAAK,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAf;YAAA,wBACE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADF,eAEE;cAAA,sPACwO,GADxO;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAFF;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAlCF,eAwCE;YAAK,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAf;YAAA,wBACE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADF,eAEE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAFF;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAxCF,eAmDE;YAAK,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAf;YAAA,wBACE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADF,eAEE;cAAA,wBACE;gBAAA;cAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;cAAA,QADF,eAME;gBAAA;cAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;cAAA,QANF,eAYE;gBAAA;cAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;cAAA,QAZF,eAgBE;gBAAA;cAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;cAAA,QAhBF,eAuBE;gBAAA;cAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;cAAA,QAvBF,eA4BE;gBAAA;cAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;gBAAA;cAAA,QA5BF;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAFF;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAnDF,eAyFE;YAAK,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAf;YAAA,wBACE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADF,eAEE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAFF;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAzFF;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAJF;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA;IADF;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAFF,eAmHE,QAAC,MAAD;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAnHF;EAAA;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QADF;AAuHD,CAxHD;;KAAMA,U;AA0HN,eAAeA,UAAf"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
