Even being\n                coughed upon by a person with COVID-9 infection can qualify you\n                as a close contact. The health departments identify close\n                contacts through what is known as contact tracing.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"guidelines-item\">\n              <h3>Self-isolation</h3>\n              <p>\n                Isolation, unlike quarantine, is when a person confirmed to have\n                a contagious disease has to separate themselves from healthy\n                individuals around them. This is done to prevent the spread of\n                infection among the common masses.{\" \"}\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"guidelines-item\">\n              <h3>Self-isolation versus Quarantine</h3>\n              <p>\n                While isolation achieves the same purpose as quarantine, it is\n                only for those who are infected or are confirmed cases of\n                COVID-19. Quarantines last for the duration of the upper limit\n                of the incubation period of the virus, which is 14 days in this\n                case. However, isolation lasts until the individual is free of\n                symptoms and tests negative for the virus.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"guidelines-item\">\n              <h3>What should you do in quarantine or isolation?</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  If you are within the limits of your home, do not leave unless\n                  it is necessary.

Wash your hands for twenty seconds with\n                  soap and water frequently. Use your elbow to cough or sneeze\n                  into or use a tissue and immediately throw it in a covered\n                  dustbin.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  Stay calm: While it is natural to feel anxious and scared,\n                  being educated about your situation is a great way to combat\n                  anxiety.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  Follow instructions and co-operate with the authorities:\n                  Following the quarantine process and other public health\n                  mandates play a big role in preventing and slowing the spread\n                  of contagious diseases.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"guidelines-item\">\n              <h3>Social distancing</h3>\n              <p>\n                Social distancing means any measures taken to increase physical\n                space between people to slow or prevent the spread of the virus.\n                This involves avoiding public gatherings, limiting the number of\n                visitors to your home, staying at home more often, keeping a\n                safe distance from other people and catching up with friends and\n                family virtually instead of in person. If you have to be around\n                people, maintain a distance of 2 meters or 6 feet from others\n                around you as much as possible.
